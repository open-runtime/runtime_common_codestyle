* **Stable Lint Codes:** Upgraded custom lints to avoid deprecated getters, ensuring version stability with newer `analyzer` packages.
* **Analyzer Configuration Fixes:** Resolved analyzer issues by correcting invalid strict typing overrides in `recommended.yaml`.
* **Workspace Readiness:** Aligned `custom_lint_builder` leaf constraints and migrated it to a git dependency for monorepo compatibility.
* **Enhanced Documentation:** Added `USAGE.md`, `SETUP.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` for clearer integration and AI-assisted workflows.
